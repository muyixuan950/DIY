      <h1>About DIYBox</h1>
      <p>
        DIYBox was born from a quiet wish: to make space in modern life for simple, joyful creation.
        In a world that rushes forward, we wanted to offer something slower — a box that feels like a Sunday morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every month, we design kits that are meant to be felt — not just finished. We choose materials that invite touch, instructions that invite calm, and themes that remind you to play. No pressure. No perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're crafting alone or with someone you love, DIYBox is our way of saying: you deserve to make something beautiful, with your own hands, for no one but yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're so glad you're here.
