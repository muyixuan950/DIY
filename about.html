      <h1>About CRAFTING FRIENDSHIP</h1>
      <p>
      Every month, we deliver a curated activity box straight to your door — designed for 2 to 6 friends. Each box contains everything you need for a cozy, creative get-together: high-quality materials, step-by-step instructions, and little extras to make your time together truly special.
        </p>
      <p>
      You decide what fits your group best — choose from candle making to designing your own plant pot, or let curiosity guide you with our Surprise Box.
      Each experience is designed to help you unleash new hobbies, learn something new, and build lasting connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a world that moves fast, we create space for women to slow down, laugh, and reconnect through creativity. Each box brings your group everything you need for a shared experience, from crafting materials to meaningful memories.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're more than a subscription; we're a reminder that friendship is something you build, one moment at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're so glad you're here.
